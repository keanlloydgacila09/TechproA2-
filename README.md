ITS Description
This Java console application allows users to create and manage a small shopping list.

The program also handles early termination (if the user presses Enter with no input) and displays how many items were added.


How It Works

2. The program prints all entered items in a comma-separated list.  
3. It then shows how many items were added.  
4. The user can search for an item to see if it exists in the list.
